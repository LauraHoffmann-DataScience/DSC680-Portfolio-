### Project 2: Australian Housing Market Exploratory Analysis
#### Topic
Analyze the housing markets in Australia to gain a better understanding of pricing, and possibly explore building a model for price prediction.
#### Business Problem
The housing market has become a turbulent market to navigate with a lot of unpredictable factors about our future, especially after the spread of a global pandemic. My sister moved to Australia in 2018 and is now engaged to an Australian and they are perusing the housing market in such a questionable and uncertain current world climate. I would like to find a dataset for the housing market in Australia that would aid in the analyzing and exploration of the market so I could better help my sister feel more comfortable in her house purchasing endeavors.

### Project 6: Stroke Prediction Modeling
#### Topic
Analyze stroke data to gain a better understanding on what variables might predict having a stroke.
#### Business Problem
As we get older many factors can contribute to the possibility of a stroke. Usually these instances occur spontaneously and are a surprise to most when they happen. I would like to create a model that explores the variables and how they might add or subtract from the possibility of a stroke in order to give individuals a better idea on if they might be at risk for such a medical setback to add the possibility of prevention.
