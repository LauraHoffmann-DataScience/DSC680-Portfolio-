### Project 2: Australian Housing Market Exploratory Analysis
#### Topic
Analyze the housing markets in Australia to gain a better understanding of pricing, and possibly explore building a model for price prediction.
#### Business Problem
The housing market has become a turbulent market to navigate with a lot of unpredictable factors about our future, especially after the spread of a global pandemic. My sister moved to Australia in 2018 and is now engaged to an Australian and they are perusing the housing market in such a questionable and uncertain current world climate. I would like to find a dataset for the housing market in Australia that would aid in the analyzing and exploration of the market so I could better help my sister feel more comfortable in her house purchasing endeavors.

### Project 6: Hotel Recommendation Modeling
#### Topic:
Pulling data from Expedia to predict which hotels to recommend to users in order to have the highest success rate in bookings.
#### Problem: 
Online travel agencies are scrambling to meet the artificial intelligence driven personalization standard set by companies like Amazon and Netflix. In addition, the world of online travel has become a highly competitive space where brands try to capture our attention (and wallet) with recommending, comparing, matching, and sharing. For this assignment, we would like to create the optimal hotel recommendations for Expedia’s users that are searching for a hotel to book. For this assignment, you need to predict which “hotel cluster” the user is likely to book, given his (or her) search details.

### Project 8: Stroke Prediction Modeling
#### Topic:
Analyze stroke data to gain a better understanding on what variables might predict having a stroke.
#### Problem:
As we get older many factors can contribute to the possibility of a stroke. Usually these instances occur spontaneously and are a surprise to most when they happen. I would like to create a model that explores the variables and how they might add or subtract from the possibility of a stroke in order to give individuals a better idea on if they might be at risk for such a medical setback to add the possibility of prevention.
