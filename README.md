My sister moved to Australia in 2018 and is now engaged to an Australian and they are perusing the housing market in such a questionable and uncertain current world climate. I would like to find a dataset for the housing market in Australia that would aid in the analyzing and exploration of the market so I could better help my sister feel more comfortable in her house purchasing endeavors.
