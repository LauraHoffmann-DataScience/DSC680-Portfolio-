### Project 1: Airline Safety Visualization/Promotion
#### Topic
Traveling always poses the question of safety, this project will assess the safety in popular forms of travel with the hopes of swaying an audience toward a certain travel form.
#### Business Problem
Airlines can struggle with convincing potential customers of their safety over other forms of travel. This makes it difficult for the airlines to secure customers that are questioning the safety of airline travel. The quesioning leads customers that are on the fence about types of travel to err on the side of caution and take the form of travel they are more familiar with which is land travel by car. Utilizing data we should be able to visually represent and prove to an audience that airline travel is the safest form of travel especially for long distances. This type of customer swaying can help improve the business and increase profits.

### Project 2: Australian Housing Market Exploratory Analysis
#### Topic
Analyze the housing markets in Australia to gain a better understanding of pricing, and possibly explore building a model for price prediction.
#### Business Problem
The housing market has become a turbulent market to navigate with a lot of unpredictable factors about our future, especially after the spread of a global pandemic. My sister moved to Australia in 2018 and is now engaged to an Australian and they are perusing the housing market in such a questionable and uncertain current world climate. I would like to find a dataset for the housing market in Australia that would aid in the analyzing and exploration of the market so I could better help my sister feel more comfortable in her house purchasing endeavors.

### Project 3: Beer Ratings Exploratory Analysis
#### Topic
Craft beers and breweries are growing in popularity around the United States, so this exploratory project will assess what variables go into making a great beer.
#### Business Problem
There is a social media platform for almost everything now a days, from book reading to beer drinking. Data recorded from these apps for beer drinking reveals ratings for thousands of beers across the country. These ratings can be explored to reveal what goes into making a high scoring beer. This will allow breweries to adjust how and what they are brewing so that they can focus on crafting the perfect brew for their customers after knowing exactly what they're looking for.

### Project 4: Candy Data Cleaning
#### Topic
Halloween Candy
#### Business Problem
The issue with this project lies in the problem with messy data sets that do not give audiences a lot of information until the data is cleaned and processed.

### Project 5: Dodger (Baseball Game) Promotion Modeling
#### Topic
#### Business Problem

### Project 6: Hotel Recommendation Modeling
#### Topic:
Pulling data from Expedia to predict which hotels to recommend to users in order to have the highest success rate in bookings.
#### Problem: 
Online travel agencies are scrambling to meet the artificial intelligence driven personalization standard set by companies like Amazon and Netflix. In addition, the world of online travel has become a highly competitive space where brands try to capture our attention (and wallet) with recommending, comparing, matching, and sharing. For this assignment, we would like to create the optimal hotel recommendations for Expedia’s users that are searching for a hotel to book. For this assignment, you need to predict which “hotel cluster” the user is likely to book, given his (or her) search details.

### Project 7: Spotify Like Prediction Modeling
#### Topic
The streaming business is booming, not only in terms of television and movie content but also in the music industry.
#### Business Problem
Dozens of audio streaming platforms sharing everything from songs to podcasts and standup routines are being utilized by millions around the globe every day. To keep the business of their subscribers and continue making money, these platforms must ensure that customers are satisfied with their services, not only of quality and quantity of the streaming content but also of recommending new content that users enjoy. Exploring a data set and building a functional model in the prediction for recommendation of Spotify songs could help the business in how it interacts with its users. Being able to successfully suggest new content for users to listen to can act as a type of customer retention for the business.

### Project 8: Stroke Prediction Modeling
#### Topic:
Analyze stroke data to gain a better understanding on what variables might predict having a stroke.
#### Problem:
As we get older many factors can contribute to the possibility of a stroke. Usually these instances occur spontaneously and are a surprise to most when they happen. I would like to create a model that explores the variables and how they might add or subtract from the possibility of a stroke in order to give individuals a better idea on if they might be at risk for such a medical setback to add the possibility of prevention.

### Project 9: Titanic Survival Prediction Modeling
#### Topic:
The sinking of The Titanic is one of the most well known incidents around the globe.
#### Problem:
This project takes in data collected about the passengers aboard The Titanic including whether they lived or died, and builds a model to predict whether if a person was on board whether they would survive the sinking.
