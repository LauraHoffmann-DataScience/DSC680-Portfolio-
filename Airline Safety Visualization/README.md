# Airline Safety Data Presentation and Visualization

## Topic

Traveling always poses the question of safety, this project will assess the safety in popular forms of travel with the hopes of swaying an audience toward a certain travel form.

## Business Problem

Airlines can struggle with convincing potential customers of their safety over other forms of travel. This makes it difficult for the airlines to secure customers that are questioning the safety of airline travel. The quesioning leads customers that are on the fence about types of travel to err on the side of caution and take the form of travel they are more familiar with which is land travel by car. Utilizing data we should be able to visually represent and prove to an audience that airline travel is the safest form of travel especially for long distances. This type of customer swaying can help improve the business and increase profits.
