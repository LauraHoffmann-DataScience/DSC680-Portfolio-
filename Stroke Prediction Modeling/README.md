# Stroke Prediction Modeling

## Topic
Analyze stroke data to gain a better understanding on what variables might predict having a stroke.
## Business Problem
As we get older many factors can contribute to the possibility of a stroke. Usually these instances occur spontaneously and are a surprise to most when they happen. I would like to create a model that explores the variables and how they might add or subtract from the possibility of a stroke in order to give individuals a better idea on if they might be at risk for such a medical setback to add the possibility of prevention.
