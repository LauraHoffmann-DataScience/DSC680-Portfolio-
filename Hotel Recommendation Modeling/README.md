# Traveling Model Building - Expedia Hotel Recommendations

## Topic:
Pulling data from Expedia to predict which hotels to recommend to users in order to have the highest success rate in bookings.
## Problem: 
Online travel agencies are scrambling to meet the artificial intelligence driven personalization standard set by companies like Amazon and Netflix. In addition, the world of online travel has become a highly competitive space where brands try to capture our attention (and wallet) with recommending, comparing, matching, and sharing. For this assignment, we would like to create the optimal hotel recommendations for Expedia’s users that are searching for a hotel to book. For this assignment, you need to predict which “hotel cluster” the user is likely to book, given his (or her) search details.
